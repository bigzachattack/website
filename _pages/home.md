Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet.

Over the course of a decade, I've devoted myself to tackling performance problems across a wide spectrum of areas, including hardware tuning, kernel hacking, and application and algorithm optimizations. I've worked on numerous projects over the years, collaborating with developers, SREs, and leadership to achieve optimal performance across entire systems. Through these opportunities, I've gained a deep understanding of how performance engineering fits into the larger picture of software development and system design.
 
It is common to find me taking detours into building analytic tools, since in my opinion, performance analysis is a specialized data science workflow. Currently, I am helping to build and strengthen systems, performance, and observability efforts at Meta.  We recently released an open-source version of our telemetry agent, Dynolog, that you can find on [Github](https://github.com/facebookincubator/dynolog).
